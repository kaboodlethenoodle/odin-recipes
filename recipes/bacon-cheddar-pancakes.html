			<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Sweet and savoury twist on a favourite American breakfast food.</p>
				<p>More popularly known as "Mancakes". Ugh.</p>
			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>1 cup or 8 ounces bacon, chopped</li>
					<li>1/2 cup thinly sliced green onions</li>
					<li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
					<li>3/4 cup cornmeal</li>
					<li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
					<li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
					<li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
					<li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
					<li>1 1/3 cups milk</li>
					<li>~60 g or 2 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, grated</li>
					<li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
					<li>2 tbsps butter, melted</li>
					<li>1 tbsp white sugar</li>
					<li>1 cup warm maple syrup</li>
					<li>Chili powder, to taste (1/8 tsp recommended)</li>
					<li>1 tsp vegetable oil</li>
					<li>1 tsp butter</li>
				</ul>
			<h2>Steps</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
					<li>Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Off heat, stir green onions into bacon; sauté in hot drippings until slightly softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer bacon mixture to a strainer; drain. Reserve drippings.</li>
					<li>Whisk flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl; whisk in drained bacon mixture, milk, Cheddar cheese, eggs, melted butter, and sugar until batter is smooth. Let batter rest for 10 minutes.</li>
					<li>Whisk maple syrup and chipotle chile powder together in a small bowl until chile powder is completely dissolved.</li>
					<li>Heat 1 teaspoon reserved drippings, 1 teaspoon oil, and 1 teaspoon butter on a griddle over medium-high heat. Drop ¼ cupfuls of batter per mancake onto the griddle; cook until bubbles form and edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
					<li>Flip; cook until browned on other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
					<li>Transfer to a plate; top with maple syrup.</li>
